# GD4 Representativeness Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The Global Dialogues 4 (GD4) survey collected responses from 600 unique participants across 57 countries. This report analyzes how well the sample represents the global population across three key dimensions using the Global Representativeness Index (GRI).

### Key Findings

| Dimension | GRI Score | Diversity Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Country × Gender × Age | 0.000 | 0.000 | Extremely poor representation |
| Country × Religion | 0.414 | 0.422 | Moderate representation |
| Country × Environment | 0.307 | 0.424 | Poor to moderate representation |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Country × Gender × Age (GRI: 0.000)

This dimension shows **extremely poor representativeness** due to:

- **Age group misalignment**: Only 16.7% of age categories matched benchmark data
  - Missing mappings for age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64
  - Only the 65+ age group was properly mapped
- **Gender coverage issues**: "Other" gender category not mapped to benchmarks (33.3% unmapped)
- **Country naming mismatches**: 5 countries (8.8%) had naming differences from benchmarks

**Most under-represented segments:**
- India Male 18-25 (2.2% of global population, 0% in sample)
- India Male 26-35 (2.1% of global population, 0% in sample)
- India Female 18-25 (2.0% of global population, 0% in sample)
- China demographics across all age/gender combinations

### 2. Country × Religion (GRI: 0.414)

This dimension shows **moderate representativeness** with some significant biases:

**Over-represented segments:**
- Kenya Christianity: 17.3% of sample vs 0.5% of global population (+16.8% deviation)
- Chile non-religious: 4.2% of sample vs 0.02% of global population (+4.0% deviation)
- United States Christianity: 7.0% of sample vs 3.5% of global population (+3.5% deviation)

**Under-represented segments:**
- China non-religious: 2.3% of sample vs 10.2% of global population (-7.8% deviation)
- China Other religious groups: 0% of sample vs 4.4% of global population
- China Buddhism: 0.5% of sample vs 3.5% of global population (-3.0% deviation)

### 3. Country × Environment (GRI: 0.307)

This dimension shows **poor to moderate representativeness** with strong urban bias:

**Over-represented segments:**
- Kenya Urban: 17.8% of sample vs 0.2% of global population (+17.7% deviation)
- India Urban: 14.7% of sample vs 6.0% of global population (+8.6% deviation)
- Chile Urban: 5.7% of sample vs 0.2% of global population (+5.5% deviation)

**Under-represented segments:**
- India Rural: 1.3% of sample vs 11.7% of global population (-10.4% deviation)
- China Urban: 2.8% of sample vs 11.0% of global population (-8.1% deviation)
- China Rural: 0.2% of sample vs 7.6% of global population (-7.4% deviation)

## Sample Characteristics

### Geographic Distribution
- **Top 5 countries by sample size:**
  1. Kenya: 112 participants (18.7%)
  2. India: 96 participants (16.0%)
  3. United States: 54 participants (9.0%)
  4. Chile: 36 participants (6.0%)
  5. Brazil: 28 participants (4.7%)

### Coverage Gaps
- **Missing major populations**: Several populous countries are severely under-represented or absent
- **Urban bias**: Strong over-representation of urban populations, particularly in developing countries
- **Regional concentration**: Heavy concentration in Kenya and India (34.7% of total sample)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix age group mappings**: Ensure all age categories in the survey match benchmark definitions
2. **Standardize country names**: Resolve naming mismatches (e.g., "United States" vs "United States of America")
3. **Review gender categories**: Map "Other" category appropriately for benchmark comparison

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Increase China representation**: Currently severely under-represented despite being ~18% of global population
2. **Balance urban/rural sampling**: Current sample heavily skews urban, missing large rural populations
3. **Diversify religious representation**: Particularly for Asian religious/non-religious populations
4. **Expand geographic coverage**: Include more participants from missing or under-represented regions

### Future Sampling Strategy
- Consider stratified sampling based on global population proportions
- Set minimum quotas for major demographic segments
- Use the GRI framework during data collection to monitor representativeness in real-time
